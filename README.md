Mono.Data.OdbcCore  
  
ODBC for .Net Core is based on old version of Mono prior to Mono including parts from the .Net Reference source.  
  
This project is abandoned.

Please get System.Data.Odbc for .Net Core from here.  
https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Data.Odbc/
  
-----------------------------------------------------------  
  
A better implementation would be based on the .NET Framework Reference Source.  
  
Update 04/22/2017 - please see .NET Core FX repo - someone has ported Microsoft's System.Data.Odbc to .Net Core  
https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/13035  
https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/tree/master/src/System.Data.Odbc  
  
Update 04/23/2017 - converted Visual Studio solution/project to Visual Studio 2017 and add compiler define for libodbc.cs  
  
To enable this to work on a particular platform, define this in libodbc.cs  
  ODBC_WINDOWS to define Windows to use "odbc32.dll"   
  ODBC_LINUX to define Linux to use "libodbc.so"  
  ODBC_MAC to define Mac OS to use "libodbc.dynlib"  
  
Example:  
#define ODBC_WINDOWS  
  
Right now, Mono.Data.OdbcCore works on .Net Core on Windows.  I need to platform invoke into libraries on other platforms like Linux by using 
a different shared library name.  Example: Windows has  foo.dll while Linux has libfoo.so and Mac has libfoo.dynlib
